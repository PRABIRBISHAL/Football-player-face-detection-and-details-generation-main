# ⚽ Football Player Face Detection and Details Generation  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered system** designed to detect football players' faces from images/videos and generate their details, such as name, team, and statistics. It utilizes **deep learning, computer vision, and machine learning** techniques to recognize players and retrieve their information.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Face Detection:** Detects football players' faces using OpenCV & Dlib.  
✅ **Face Recognition:** Identifies players using pre-trained CNN models.  
✅ **Player Details Retrieval:** Fetches player info from a dataset or online sources.  
✅ **Real-time Processing:** Works on live match footage or images.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Main Language)  
- **OpenCV** (For Image Processing)  
- **Dlib** (For Face Detection & Recognition)  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (For Deep Learning)  
- **Scikit-learn** (For ML Models)  
- **Flask/FastAPI** (For API Integration)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (For Data Handling)  

## 🚀 Installation Guide  
### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/football-face-detection.git
cd football-face-detection
```

### **Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment**  
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 4: Download Pre-trained Models**  
Download face recognition models (e.g., `dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat`) from:  
🔗 [Dlib Model Download](http://dlib.net/files/)  

### **Step 5: Run the Project**  
```bash
python app.py
```

## 🎥 How It Works  
1️⃣ Input an image or video frame.  
2️⃣ Detect football player faces using **Dlib/OpenCV**.  
3️⃣ Identify players using **Deep Learning (CNN)**.  
4️⃣ Fetch player details from **pre-built datasets** or APIs.  
5️⃣ Display player name, team, and other details.  

## 📚 Dataset  
- Pre-trained models from **FaceNet, VGGFace, or Dlib**.  
- Custom football player datasets (e.g., FIFA, ESPN API).  

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
🔹 **Live match tracking integration**  
🔹 **Pose estimation for player movements**  
🔹 **Integration with sports analytics platforms**
